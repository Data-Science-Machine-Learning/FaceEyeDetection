# FaceEyeDetection
This is example of face and eye detection from camera video source. Here we have used cascade classifier for detection of faces and eyes. Also we are taking snap shot of our region of interest of face detected and save it also. Here I have used two xml files which helps us to detect face and eye from frame. From link https://github.com/opencv/opencv/tree/master/data/haarcascades you can use different available xml files as per your need. The live_face_detection.py is main file and has all code for face and eye detection. Have uploaed some of captured images which are faces detected in live video frame from camera.
